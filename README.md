# **ResuRalph ü§ñüìÑ**

### A Discord bot for collaborative resume feedback

In today's competitive tech job market, a standout resume is the first step toward success. However, the resume review process can often be cumbersome.

- Long, overwhelming review threads, where comments can easily get buried and overlooked.
- Reviewers forced to download PDFs to view resume's and updated resume's, which becomes increasingly tedious with each incremental change.
- The frustration of manually identifying and specifying which parts of the resume you're referring to.
- Comparing two resume PDF's and trying to identify what changes were made by the user.

## **ResuRalph streamlines this process.**

## **The Flow** ‚è≥

### **Initial Upload**
- Upload your resume as a PDF using the **/upload** command.
- ResuRalph validates the PDF, stores it in AWS S3, and saves metadata in DynamoDB.
- The bot generates a [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) annotation link for collaborative review.
- Share this link with reviewers who can leave **in-line** annotations directly on your resume.

### **Getting Feedback**
- Use **/get_annotations** to pull annotations from reviewers directly into Discord.
- Try **/ai_review** for AI-powered feedback and annotations (limited to once per day).
- View all your resume versions with **/get_all_resumes**.
- Get your latest resume link anytime with **/get_latest_resume**.

### **Updating & Comparing**
- Use **/update** to upload an improved version of your resume.
- Enable the **show_diff** option to see changes between versions:
  üü¢**Added:** "Project X | React, Node, SQL..."
  üî¥**Removed:** "Work Experience Y | Example Company..."
- Use **/get_resume_diff** to compare any two resume versions.
- **/clear_resumes** permanently removes all your data from the system.
